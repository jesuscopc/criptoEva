# Cripto currency table API wrote in reactjs

## Description

Little App to get criptos and show in a table


## Details
typescript
reactjs
hooks

### The Application

We are very enthusiastic about Crypto! We would like to have a site to view the top 50 Cryptos based on Market Cap. In the first part of this project, we would like to see a list of the 50 best cryptos, and we want to be able to filter them by:

1. Name
2. Price
3. Market Cap
4. Circulating Supply (For example, Bitcoin Max supply is 21 Million Bitcoins, but the circulating supply is approx. 18 million)

## Requirements

As we said before, it can take you a couple of hours or a day.

1. You can use [this api](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/) or any other API (just try to complete the requirements)
2. Use Typescript
3. Use Hooks
4. Refactor the code
5. Format values (dates, prices, etc)
6. Use TailwindCSS
7. Testing suite
8. Good use of git (commits, pull requests, branches)
9. Use of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
